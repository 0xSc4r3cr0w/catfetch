It's another command-line system information tool...but with cats...

First of all, this script is meant to run on Arch-based operating systems, but the MIT license allows you to do whatever you want with it, so feel free to fork the project for your favorite distro.

Secondly I tried to use only programs that are by default on the system, so the idea is that any Arch Linux user can use catfetch without any complications.

Now let's get to the part about how to use it...

# 🛠️  H O W - T O - I N S T A L L  🛠️
To install catfetch, first clone the repository on your system.
```
git clone https://github.com/nekolink/catfetch.git
```

Then enter the folder and give permission to run the installer.sh file.
```
cd catfetch
chmod +x installer.sh
```

The installer will install catfetch in the folder /usr/local/bin/ and the logo file will be in the folder /usr/local/src/.

Now the hardest part, and I don't know if you will be able to do it, is to run catfetch.
```
catfetch
```

# ⚠️  U N I N S T A L L  ⚠️ 
Give execute permission to the file uninstaller.sh and then run it, when it reaches the end catfetch will indeed be uninstalled from your system.
```
chmod +x uninstall.sh
```
